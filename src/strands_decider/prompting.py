"""Turning a (state, question) pair into text, and slots into meaning.

The whole trick of the architecture lives here. The classification heads are
*generic*: head k has no fixed meaning. It scores "whatever option was listed at
position k in the prompt". Nothing in the weights knows that slot 0 is `billing`
in one request and `Calm` in the next -- the prompt alone establishes that binding,
which is what makes the model adapt to novel label sets without retraining.

Two consequences shape everything downstream:

1. The prompt must number the options explicitly and unambiguously, so the
   binding is learnable and stable.
2. Training must shuffle option order (see data/collate.py), or the heads quietly
   memorise "slot 0 tends to be the positive class" and genericity is lost.
